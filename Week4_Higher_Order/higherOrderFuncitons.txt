What are higher order functions.
    Higher order functions are function that takes functions as arguments
    They are used for mapping, filtering, folding, and sorting of lists
    They promote the modulariyy of programs
        Writing higher order funcitons that are applicable in many cases makes the program readable rather than writing recursive functions for individual cases


(apply char<? lst) ; charachter lists
(apply string<? lst) ; string lists
(apply < lst) ; numerical lists

Why are they useful
    Common prgraming idioms can be encoded as functions within the language itself
    Domain specific languages can be defined as collections of higher-order functions
        For example, higher order funcitons can be ised to reason about processing lists
    Algebric properties of higher-order functions can be used to reason about programs

The ugly side of higher-order functions
    not always built-in
        versions of Scheme varies widely
    if you do not find the higher-order funciton you need you have to find itself
        in Gambit you had to find them
    once the code is downloaded it then needs to be included with your code
        in this case, we need to add to our Unix server
