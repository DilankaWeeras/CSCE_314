Syntax
    The form form or structure of the language

    Lexeme
        Lowest level syntactic unit of a language
        Numerical limits, operators, special words, ect.
    Token
        is a category of lexemes(identifiers)
        words in a Syntax
    
Lexeme and Token

    exp.
        const { } cout << 23.23; "Lupoli"

Scanner
    converts the text in the ide into a parse tree.
    parse tree (compiler) tries to match code into somthing that makes sense
    
Urnary operators
    operatirs that act upon a single operand,
    set around a value
        prefix or postfix around the value
        3 - (-2), x++
    C++ exp:
        ++i
        i++
        &x
        *x

Grammars
    context free and regular

Context free Grammars
    CFG for the language
        Left hand side has all values that are non-terminala
        epsilon is null

Overall set of senteces or rules is called a Grammars
    Within the senteces there are nontermianls

    Terminals also exist in the sentence

Backus -Naur form 
    A form of CFG

Lists in Grammar
    not the array or list data structure
    items of the same data type

How to solve trees
    It is bottom up
    Leaces are solved first
    tree=recursive, remeber the last calid recursive call REALLY gets solved first
    we use this idea for precedence below.
